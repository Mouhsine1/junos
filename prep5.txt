							<Python & PyEZ>


- why ? : easy to read (white space) ; heavily used in devops ; large community 

- interpreted language 

- object orientated 

 import time <====== this is a library =======> we use this style when we want to use multiple functions from this lib
                                               in this case we should refer to the library every time we use a fct lib.fct

 from time import set-time <====== this is a function we use this when we want to use only one function from this lib
                                   here we could use the function without making lib.fct just type the name of the fct

- everything in python is object 

- function also is an object on python

---> to see all methods and attributes associated with an object : 
   
      > print(dir(a))
